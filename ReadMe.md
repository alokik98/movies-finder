# [Movie Finder App](https://movies-finder-9b6fd.web.app/)

This is a web app created using ReactJs and Firebase. Here after login, the user can search for any movie, tv series or shows and can view details about that after clicking on the image.

The user can also add their favourite movie to my list section, which will be retained even after the user is logout.

## Api and Tech Used
For this project, I use [themoviedb API](https://www.themoviedb.org). [Redux](https://redux.js.org) to store the global variable and states and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com) for user authentication.

2. Click on Sign Up Now.
3. The user will be created and able to see the homepage.

To run on the local system, nodejs must be installed on the system(pre-requisite). After that follow the steps:
1. Clone the git repo into your system or download and unzip the zip file.
2. Go inside the folder and open the terminal/cmd in the exact location.
3. In terminal write: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4. After the installation is done, write: `npm start` or `yarn start`.
5. By doing this, you will be able to access the project in your localhost.
